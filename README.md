## Status ğŸ”§

I'm currently working on this project. It still misses the last 3 requirements, the others were achieved.

These are the requirements for this project from frontendMentor challenges:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- Navigate the whole project and perform all actions using only their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
